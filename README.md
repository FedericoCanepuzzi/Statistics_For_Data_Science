## Introduction
This project shows and explains the analysis of the AIDA dataset, which aims at a business failure prediction, risk factors exploration, and distributions investigation.


## Question A
 - Compare the distributions of size and age between failed and active companies at a specific year
 - Do they change for a specific company form?
 - Do they change for a specific sector?
